# DataScience_Practice


# Data Visualization --> Graphing
# Libary --> numpy, matplotlib (graphing)

# Machine Leaning --> subfield of ai that allows the computer to learn something from data --> statistical method
# Deep learning (neutral network) --> it is another subfield of AI which utilizes artifical neural networks which contains multiple layers --> mimicing human train of thought
# Its advantages: it is ore accurate and has better AI performance than ML in complicated tasks
# Its disadvantages: its more difficult to implement + it usually has a larger model (takes up more storage)

Deep Learning can be used to filter out spam emails to keep inboxes tidy --> we are imitating human performance (not a rigorous task)
Machine Learning is used to perform medical diagnosis --> ml > dl because medical diagnosis predominantly involves quantitative data
Deep Learning can be used to programe autopilot cars --> much safer to use dl instead of ml because companies would be expected to perfect their car prototype
Machine Learning can be used for predicting stocks --> quantitative data
